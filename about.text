Hi! I'm Thomas Kappler.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer for [Luware](https://luware.com/). I live in Germany, after Seattle, Zurich, Geneva, Germany.

I used to work for [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) on Infrastructure as Code tools, SDKs, and Azure support. Here are my public [PRs](https://github.com/search?q=is%3Apr+author%3Athomas11+org%3Apulumi++&type=pullrequests&state=closed) and [blog posts](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/author/thomas-kappler/).

Before that, I was an engineer for Microsoft Azure working on the backend of
[Cognitive Search (now AI Search)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-search/), having fun with distributed systems and rollouts.

See [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomaskappler/) for the full bio.

I co-authored a few [publications](/publications.html).

## Colophon

This website is generated by [blog11](https://github.com/thomas11/blog11), a static blog generator
I wrote in Go. The colors are inspired by the
[new house colors](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1966932/new_house_colors)
theme. The site is hosted through [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

I aimed for extreme simplicity and use neither JavaScript nor external resources such as web
fonts. This is not to say that I consider this the right approach for all web sites.
